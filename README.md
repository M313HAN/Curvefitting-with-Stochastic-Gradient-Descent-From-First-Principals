<h1>Curvefitting with Stochastic Gradient Descent From First Principals</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project demonstrates the use of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm from first principles in order to fit polynomials of various orders to different sets of randomly generated datapoints. The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate my understanding of the mathematics behind SGD and as well as its applications in ML.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
- Implement the SGD algorithm

\-Apply the SGD algorithm in order to fit polynomials of various orders to randomly generated datapoints
